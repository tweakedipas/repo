            "localizedDescription": "Really Bad Chess is just like chess, but with totally random pieces. Try 8 Knights, 4 Bishops, and 3 pawns — why not?\n\nAs heard on NPR's Weekend Edition\n\n5 out of 5 Stars \"An essential puzzle experience for anyone even remotely interested in strategy games\" - TouchArcade\n\nWhether you play chess daily, or quit just after learning the rules, this small twist will open the door to an entire new world of chess.\n\n------WHATS IN THE “BOX”?\nThe free version of Really Bad Chess lets you compete vs. an AI in Ranked, Daily, or Weekly Challenges. Improve your skills using the included Freeplay mode. A single in-app purchase unlocks Versus Mode so you can compete against your friends locally! It also removes ads, displays captured pieces, and adds soothing alternate color-palettes to choose from.\n\n------REALLY BAD PRESS\n\n\"Makes chess fun even if you’re really bad\" - The Verge\n\n\"Feels more modern than chess has ever felt\" - Applenapps\n\n\"Really Bad Chess takes a really bad idea and somehow manages to make it a lot of fun.\" - Pocket Gamer\n\n\"Really good fun\" - MacLife\n\n------A WORD FROM THE DEVELOPER\t\nChess is one of those games I always wished I enjoyed, but its commitment to beauty, elegance, and perfect balance always turned me away. Really Bad Chess removes these boring restrictions and flips chess on its head.\n\nAs much as random pieces change the game in some ways, I was really surprised to notice how much the game remains the same, and how powerful some pieces are — you've never truly struggled against a pawn until you've struggled against a pawn in the back row.\n\nFor chess pros, Really Bad Chess will give you a new type of challenge — the pieces &amp; the moves are the same, but you'll have to throw out your openings and your understanding of normal patterns of play. \n\nFor novice chess players (like most of us), Really Bad Chess greatly opens up the game. Instead of starting by studying openings, in your first games you'll get to discover the joy (and challenge!) of learning how to checkmate.\n\nI hope you have as much fun with Really Bad Chess as much as I did making it.\n\n-zach",
